## **Case study**
## **Open Banking - Cash App**
 
 
### **What Is it?**
Open Banking is the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to share consumer's financial data to trusted third parties who will then use this data to provide financial products and services. For this case study, we will focus on Cash App.

### **History**
Cash App is a mobile payment service developed by Block, Inc. (formely Square Inc.) in October 2013 and named 'Square Cash' as a P2P (peer-to-peer) payment service similar to close comeptitors such as Venmo, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal amongst others.<br>At it's inception, the application afforded users the ability to transfer money to other individuals, pay for goods and services and bill payments. In later years, services within the application have expanded to include receipt of direct deposit payments and ACH payments. <br>In recent years, users can now buy and sell  cryptocurrency through the platform and also invest in stocks and ETFs within the application commission free. The platform also allows it's users to file taxes through it's acquisition on Credit Karma Tax in November 2020.

### **Services**

Through the years, Cash App has added more and more products and services to the platform. What started as a P2P service has morphed into one of the more robust Open Banking platforms.

### P2P
Using either a unique username called $cashtag, email address or phone number, users can receive or send money to other registered users.

### Banking
 Users can receive, send and store money within the service. Users can also transfer funds to their local banks.  Upon signing up, users will link at least one checking account to the service to allow this. Cash App does have a debit card.

### Cryptocurreny
As of January 2018, users can buy and sell crytpocurrency through the API. This is still limited to Bitcoin.

### Investing
In Novemebr 2020, Bloc Inc. added an investment service i nthe platfomr that allows users to trade in stocks and EFTs without a commission charge.


### **Business Model**

The Cash App application is free to download from Google Play Store, Apple App Store and other mobile store platforms. Standard money transfer services are also available to use without charge. 

Revenue is derived from charges for additional services such as:<br>

### Instant Money Withdrawals
Money transfers to users bank accounts takes 3-5 business days. Users get charged a fee of up to 1.5% of the value of the transaction to instantly get the funds to their accounts. 
### Credit Card Use 
Users who utilize credit cards are charged a fee of 3% of the value of the transaction. 
### Bitcoin  Exchange
There is a charge to buy or sell Bitcoin in the platform. 
### Charging Businesses
Businesses that accept Cash App payments are charged a fee of 2.75% of the value of the transaction
### Money Creation
Block Inc. also lends out money in their reserves to various insititions. To maintain liquidity, the company is expected to hold at least 10% of total user deposits and can lend out the rest.<p>

### **Business Impact and Potential for The Future**
### Impact
Despite intense competition in the P2P  payment industry, Cash App has continued to grow and even surpass some of its biggest competitors in the market. In 2018, Cash App surpassed Venmo in total downloads at 33.5 million. By 2021, this number had more than doubled to 70 million users.

### Potential
The platform only works locally. This is a disadvantage as users potentially travel globaly and lose access to their funds and ability to transact. This coul be an area of potential growth for the company.

At the moment, Cash App only allows trading of Bitcoin, there is potential for growth by including more popular cryptocurrencies.
